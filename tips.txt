Exploration tips:
- share of won games for players by surface – are all players universal, or is the surface
important for some of them?
- individual metrics of play quality (i. e. share of doublefaults) – are some players
special?
- correlation of match result and ranking before the match, with possible relationship
to surface
- “favourite” opponents – highly unbalanced long-term score between rather equally
ranked players

Model tips:
- prediction of the next match result
- prediction of match feature value (duration, number of games, number of aces etc.)
